# Web-Scrapping

## Problem statement

  1. POSITIVE SCORE
  2. NEGATIVE SCORE
  3. POLARITY SCORE
  4. SUBJECTIVITY SCORE
  5. AVG SENTENCE LENGTH
  6. PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS
  7. FOG INDEX
  8. AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE
  9. COMPLEX WORD COUNT
  10. WORD COUNT
  11. SYLLABLE PER WORD
  12. PERSONAL PRONOUNS
  13. AVG WORD LENGTH

Positive Score| This score is calculated by assigning the value of +1 for each word if found in the Positive Dictionary and then adding up all the values.
Negative Score| This score is calculated by assigning the value of -1 for each word if found in the Negative Dictionary and then adding up all the values. We multiply the score with -1 so that the score is a positive number.
Polarity Score|  This is the score that determines if a given text is positive or negative in nature. It is calculated by using the formula: Polarity Score = (Positive Score â€“ Negative Score)/ ((Positive Score + Negative Score) + 0.000001) Range is from -1 to +1.
Subjectivity Score| This is the score that determines if a given text is objective or subjective. It is calculated by using the formula: Subjectivity Score = (Positive Score + Negative Score)/ ((Total Words after cleaning) + 0.000001) Range is from 0 to +1
Average Sentence Length| the number of words / the number of sentences
Percentage of Complex words| the number of complex words / the number of words
Fog Index| 0.4 * (Average Sentence Length + Percentage of Complex words)
Average Number of Words Per Sentence| the total number of words / the total number of sentences
Complex word count| Complex words are words in the text that contain more than two syllables.
Word Count| We count the total cleaned words present in the text by * removing the stop words (using stopwords class of nltk package). * removing any punctuations like ? ! , . from the word before counting.
